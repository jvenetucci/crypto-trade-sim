# crypto-trade-sim
## Overview
crypto-trade-sim, also known as CryptoTS is a simulated cryptocurrency trading game that uses real-time coin prices. The application is in the form of a web app. The idea behind it is that as a new user to the game you are given X amount of USD. The goal of the game is to increase the value of your portfolio by buying and trading cryptocurencies. This is a fun and risk free way to play around with cryptocurrency trading.

Live prices are retrieved from an API, allowing the value of your portfolio and the prices at which you can buy/sell to fluctuate according to real world and real-time values.
